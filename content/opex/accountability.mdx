As Robert Bosch said, “I would rather lose money than trust.”, taking ownership means not just delivering outcomes, but doing so in a way that builds lasting trust — the cornerstone of operational excellence.
In a culture like Japan’s, where stability and tradition are deeply valued, introducing process changes such as the LCC (Logistics Costing Centering) project for RBJP came with natural resistance. Recognizing the long-term value LCC could deliver — from enhanced logistics cost transparency to stronger financial control — I took full accountability for driving its success. I led the initiative end-to-end, ensuring alignment, clear communication, and value realization. Through consistent delivery and stakeholder focus, we earned our customers’ trust, resulting in greater openness to innovation and growth across GBs.
