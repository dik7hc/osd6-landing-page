With 9 years in planning, I’ve learned that Process Orientation is key to delivering consistent, high-quality service — especially at Bosch. Together with transparency and standardization, it forms the backbone of efficient E2E operations.Process Orientation isn’t about limiting flexibility — it’s about creating clarity, enabling us to measure performance through clear KPIs, identify gaps, and continuously improve. It empowers teams to react quickly to change, align on priorities, and ensure stability across operations.
For me, success isn’t just about short-term wins. It’s about building strong, adaptable processes that support long-term goals in a structured and sustainable way.
