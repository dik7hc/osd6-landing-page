Welcome to our image grid demonstration! This page showcases the new automatic image grid layout feature that intelligently arranges images based on how many you include in a paragraph.

## Single Image Block

When you add just one image, it displays in a single column layout with full width:

This is perfect for highlighting a single important moment or focal point in your content.

## Two Image Grid

Add two images together and they automatically arrange in a 2-column grid:

This layout is ideal for before/after comparisons or showing two related perspectives.

## Three Image Grid

Three images create a balanced 3-column layout:

Perfect for showcasing multiple aspects of an event or different team activities.

## Four Image Grid

Four images display in a complete 4-column grid, creating a gallery-like experience:

This is the maximum grid size and works wonderfully for comprehensive event coverage.

## Five Images (Displays First Four)

When you add five images, the system intelligently displays only the first four in a grid:

The fifth image is automatically excluded to maintain the clean 4-column layout.

## Six Images (Also Displays First Four)

Similarly, six images will show only the first four:

This ensures your content always looks polished and professionally laid out.

## Key Features

The image grid system automatically:

- **Detects image groups** - When images are placed together in a paragraph, they're automatically grouped
- **Responsive layouts** - Adapts from 1 to 4 columns based on image count
- **Maintains aspect ratio** - All images in a grid use square aspect ratios for visual consistency
- **Shows captions** - Image titles are displayed below each image
- **Limits overflow** - Maximum of 4 images per grid to prevent visual clutter

## Best Practices

For the best results with the image grid feature:

1. **Use consistent image sizes** - While the system handles different sizes, similar dimensions look best
2. **Add descriptive titles** - The title attribute becomes the caption below each image
3. **Group related images** - Place images that tell a story together
4. **Don't exceed four** - While you can add more, only four will display

## Conclusion

This new feature makes it incredibly easy to create beautiful, professional-looking image galleries in your MDX content without any manual layout work. Just add your images, and the system handles the rest!
