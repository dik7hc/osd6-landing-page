The “Shaping the Future of LCC” workshop on 20 July 2025 brought the LCC team together to align on the current state, challenges, and future development of the organization. Throughout the session, teams reviewed LCC’s existing scope, collaboration model, and service portfolio, while outlining aspirations for a more structured, data-driven, and customer-centric operation. Strategic direction and business growth milestones were further reinforced through management’s sharing on LCC’s evolution, service expansion, and the roadmap toward logistics cost controlling, forecasting, and enhanced operational excellence.
The workshop concluded with an open dialogue addressing key questions regarding restructuring, role clarity, capability development, and the long-term vision for LCC. The discussions emphasized the need for improved processes, clearer responsibilities, strengthened internal collaboration, and continued focus on competence building as the team prepares for future transformation and service innovation.
