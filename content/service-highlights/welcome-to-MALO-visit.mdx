On September 4th – 5th, 2025, Philipp and Matthias have visited our team with a presentation that aimed to appreciate and ignite us with the mindset of building a #promisechain. In contrast to the old supply chain of storing goods and selling them to customer, this #promisechain is a circular loop that include planned promises being translated into full deliveries, going full circle back to the customer. Being a customer-forward model, many achievements have been made, across customer satisfaction, inventory, stock availability, and forecast accuracy.

Looking into the future, Matthias has mentioned the upcoming pivot from internal improvements, to strengthening external relations.
