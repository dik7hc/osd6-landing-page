In showcasing the full range of our services to other departments, we have organized the TransPlan Hub Experience Day following the 2E2 supply chain flow. 

Beginning with OSD6, consiting of logistics planning & operations, our team manages the master data, demand planning, supply planning, and shipment trakcing operations. Then proceeding with OSD3, we have the international transport team as our control tower - overseeing all shipment related updates, and the overland transport team as a focus team for trucking. With LCC team as the logistics cost center, all monthly accruals are managed with cost savings identification in mind.
