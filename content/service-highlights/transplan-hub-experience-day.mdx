Beginning with OSD6, consiting of logistics planning & operations, our team manages the master data, demand planning, supply planning, and shipment trakcing operations. Then proceeding with OSD3, we have the international transport team as our control tower - overseeing all shipment related updates, and the overland transport team as a focus team for trucking. With LCC team as the logistics cost center, all monthly accruals are managed with cost savings identification in mind.
