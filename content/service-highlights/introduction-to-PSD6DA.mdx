On May 15th – 16th, our office has welcome 3 guests from GS/PSD6-DA: Kobold Miriam, Zhao Sylvia, and Xia Ningning. With an introductory session on their second day, the team got to know more about the full inbound cockpit project and the team members of the PSD6-DA team.

With the cockpit now live, the chatbot is expected to be release soon with abilities in calculating numbers, and drawing quick charts – hence, answering our questions without having to export data onto excel.
